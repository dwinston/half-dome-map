# Half-dome Map

Use [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) to zoom in / pan around a [tiled](https://github.com/rktjmp/tileup) 16,614px by 8,406px composite photograph of the northwest face of [Half Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_Dome).

## Coming Soon

Interact with overlays that detail climbing routes, share experiences, and offer tips.

## Development

The tileset is large (~ 200 MB) and so is not here under version control. To obtain a copy of the tileset, contact Mark Thomas or Donny Winston (`markums` or `dwinst` at gmail dot com, respectfully).
